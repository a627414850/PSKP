This project allows you to patch your kernel only in a specific process. It is highly experimental and will most likely cause your system to crash. Please install some form of virtualization before messing around
with this project/library! This software is provided as-is, I have no plans on updating this code (except to add 2mb page support)... 

If you are interested in how this code works you can read about it here: [https://back.engineering/post/nasa-patch/](https://back.engineering/post/nasa-patch/).
